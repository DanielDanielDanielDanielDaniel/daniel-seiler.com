          p.text-sm Logos can be the reasons talent doesn’t join Your company, foreigners won’t adopt Your product, people don’t recognize Your company, customers don’t trust to make the buying decision and nobody can identify it anything when standing too far away.

          p.text-sm As the title indicates, values cannot be chosen freely – you can only derive values from the behavior and beliefs of the team/people. Aggregating those values and turning them into communicable symbols for representation is tough, though.
